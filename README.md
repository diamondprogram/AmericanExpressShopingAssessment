# Step 1 + 2

with Step 1 and 2 being so similar to each other the combined the 2 steaps into one if the user buys 1 apple they will get 1 free and they oranges for the price of 2, else it will calulate the prices for all items in the cart. I hard coded the prices, if the current item in the list is an apple then it add 60cents to the total and if it is an orange it adds 25 cents to the order. I have print staments to notifiy the user if the process was a scuess ad what is their total, this is for testing to see if the application works.

# Step 3

I had removed most of the print line staments in the main app, mainkly those realated to if the order was a success or not. This is the first time working with kotlin anfd the wording for the 3rd requiremnet was very vague so i made a class if a function call noticiation, wher i get a boolean (true if the process was a success and false of it failed), the list of items in the cart and the total cost and notifies the user with messages whather or not the order is valid.
